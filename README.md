ChainGrid is a blockchain-themed daily word puzzle game built with Next.js + React + TypeScript.
Every day, players discover 5 hidden crypto words inside a 9x9 grid — themed around Web3, trading, and blockchain culture.

### ⚡ High-Performance UX: Session Keys
To solve the "Transaction Fatigue" in Web3 gaming, ChainGrid implements **Ephemeral Session Keys**:
- **One-Sign Entry:** Users sign once to authorize a temporary session wallet.
- **Zero Latency:** Grid moves and game actions are signed automatically by the session key.
- **Security:** Session keys have a limited lifespan (1 hour) and cannot withdraw assets; they can only execute game-specific functions.
